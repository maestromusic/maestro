README
============

More information can be found on OMG's website http://omg.mathematik.uni-kl.de

OMG is copyright of Martin Altmayer <martin.altmayer@web.de> and Michael Helmling <helmling@mathematik.uni-kl.de> and licensed under the GPL v3 (confer the file COPYING).

INSTALLATION
==============
Download the latest release from the homepage. Be sure to have all the dependencies, then run

# easy_install3 omg-0.2.tar.gz

If you want to install OMG as normal user inside your home directory, run

$ easy_install3 --user omg-0.2.tar.gz

DEVELOPMENT
=============
To contribute in development, get the current HEAD from the git repository:

git clone git://omg.mathematik.uni-kl.de/omg.git

In order to get a working copy of the current development status, use the command

python setup.py develop --user

which will install an Egg-link inside your ~/.local/lib/python3.x folder, pointing to the git checkout. If
you use the "develop" mode instead in some directory which is not in your normal PYTHONPATH, e.g.

python setup.py develop -d ~/python-stage

you can simultaneously work with an installed version of OMG.
